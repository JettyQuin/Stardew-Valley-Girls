:: REQUIREMENTS ::
• Content Patcher

:: FEATURES ::
• Emet-Selch as a new romanceable NPC
• 11 Heart events
• Two appearance options, Solus and Hades
• New area unlocked via quest
• Option to replace generic relationship dialogue(on be default)

:: INSTALLATION ::
• Place the '[CP]Emet-Selch Custom NPC' folder into your 'Stardew Valley/Mods' folder.

:: CONFIGURATION ::
• Use the Generic Mod Configuration Menu for edits while the game is open
• Or edit the config.json file directly.
      • "Appearance" has options "Solus" or "Hades". [default Solus]
      • "Replace Generic Relationship Dialogue" is true or false. [default true]
      • "World Map Edit" has true or false. [default true]
      • "Platonic Relationship has true or false. [default false]


:: NOTES ::
• To experience the mod as intended, DO NOT propose until after seeing all
  ten-heart events. Doing otherwise may lead to inconsistent dialogue and behavior. A
  list of events and their conditions is available on the mod page at https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/13436.

:: KNOWN ISSUES ::
• If installed on a pre-existing file, the path to the new area is partially
  blocked by a bush due to how map generation works. It is still passable, just
  not by horse.
? I have not had the chance to test this on multiplayer, so I am unsure how some things might play with that. Let me know if you encounter odd behavior!

:: COMPATIBILITY ::
+  Works with Pumpkinium's Emet-Selch NPC mod
-  Possible conflict with any mod that edits the Backwoods (path north of the
    farm) map, or the northeast area of the bus stop.
