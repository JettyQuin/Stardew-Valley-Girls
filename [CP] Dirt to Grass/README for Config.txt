EnableLocations, if the internal name is on the list, then it will be applied, these should also be toggles in the Generic Mod Config Menu Mod. If you've got a mod's location that you want me to add to the list, go ahead and let me know on the modpage.
"Farm, BusStop, Backwoods, Forest, Town, Mountain, Railroad, Island_N, Island_W, All" 
are the options, it defaults to all, but if you want to customize individually you'll have to enter them like they are up there with the ones you want it applied to.

Island_W is Island Farm
