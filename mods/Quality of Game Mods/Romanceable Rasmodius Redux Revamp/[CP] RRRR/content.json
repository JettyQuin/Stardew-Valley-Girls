We have accomplished more in our brief time together than I have alone in countless human lifetimes.^^ Ironic, isn't it? So many mundane folk across the ages seek to grasp our immortality, yet it's only after embracing the mundane that I've found what it means to truly live. Never in the countless eras did I expect to find such beauty in a world that was all but dead in my eyes a mere few years ago.^^Perhaps a much younger man would have taken your presence for granted, but I as I am now wishes for nothing more than for these peaceful days to continue.^^I love you, @, now and forever.^-Magnus ^^^PS. Come back inside. I have another surprise for you.",

//Jello: This specifically happens in year 4 after the first Qi event from SVE. While this dialogue is active, all dates are disabled and several events will play. After Magnus has his breakdown, his dialogue will largely revert back to normal, but with minor changes to dialogue about defense artifacts. After the player gets the defense artifact, the dialogue will change again. There is a big focus of this being in spring because... well, I mean can you avoid the forest for an entire season???
