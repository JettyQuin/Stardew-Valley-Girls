			"Sun8": "Hey, @. Want to go grab a bite? Gus's spaghetti is something out of this world! $h",
			"Wed8": "Would you like to come over for dinner someday? $1#$b# I can make you some truly lovely spaghetti! It could be a date. $u#$e# ...*sigh* Good job, Victor. $0#$b# Ah, @! You didn't hear me, did you? $7",
			"Thu10": "My mother said that you and I make a cute couple... $0#$b# That's funny, isn't it? $l",
			"Sat10": "Hey, @, remember when I said I may have another reason for not wanting to leave the valley? $u#$b# Well, I just wanted to clear things out a little. $l#$b# That other reason... is you. I love you and I never want us to be apart. $l#$e# May we cuddle for a while? $l",
			"Tue10": "Hello there, @. It's so good to see you taking a break from work. $1#$b# Oh? You just wanted to see me? Heh, you're flattering me, love. $l#$b# Would you like to take a stroll to the beach with me later? I'd like to have you all to myself, if only for a moment. $u",
			"Wed10": "Why am I smiling? $1#$b# Well, it's because of you. You have that effect on me... $l",
			
			
			"Wed7": "Um... @, you're single, right? $0#$e# Just wondering! $l",
			"Sat8": "Heya @, did you do something different? I can't quite put my finger on it... $l#$e# It's almost like something has changed... And I can't get my eyes off you. $l#e# Either way, you look great right now. $l",
			"Fri10": "Hey, @, are you free tonight? You should stop by the saloon later. We could play Pumpkin Smasher together, it's my favorite from the saloon's arcade. $h#$b# Plus, I bet others will enjoy seeing you there. $u",

			"summer_Thu6": "Say, @, how long have you been working on that farm? $0#$b# ... $0#$b# ... $2#$b# You seriously need to take a break, @. Or at least drink some water. Here, have my water bottle. $0",

			"spring_2": "Man, I'm beat. Why does Abby always feel the need to overshare her Egg Festival strategies. $2#$b# For the love of Yoba, I'm starting to actually understand Seb. Maybe some spaghetti can cheer me up. $2#$e# ...Oh, hello there, @. I'm sorry, but I I'm not feeling to good. $0#$b# ...Please don't tell me you actually overheard me talking about Abby's Egg Festival plans. $2#$b# ... $2#$b# *Victor is now ignoring you.* ",
			"spring_9": "Great, the circus known as the Egg Hunt will begin tomorrow. Honestly, it's pretty hilarious how nobody has said anything about Abby winning every single time. $2#$b# And she will talk about her win till summer... Maybe someone should wipe that smirk this time. $2#$e# O-oh, @! You didn't hear what I just said, did you? $0#$b# Was I thinking aloud? ...Great. $2#$b# Look, you better  not tell Abby anything. $0#$b# It's not like I dislike her, okay? She's one of my closest friends, but I admit that her behavior is quite vexing sometimes. $0",
			"spring_23": "Oh man, Seb and Abby are gonna complain tomorrow again. $2#$b# I don't get it. I know it's old, but there is a certain charm to the Flower Dance. Plus, there's free food from Gus. What's not to love? $0#$e# Oh, hey, @. Are you going to the Flower Dance tomorrow? I suppose it would be a great time to unwind. $0",

			"summer_Mon8": "Are you doing alright, @? Working on the farm in such weather must be really tiring... $2#$b# How about we go relax at the beach, hmm? $1#$b# Plus, we could get some ice cream on our way there. $u",

			"winter_Sat8": "Hey there, @. Got any plans for this winter? $1#$b# ...What!? $7#$b# @, my dear. What is this 'Skull Cavern' you're talking about? $7#$e# ...On the other hand, though, you have gotten me quite curious. Do tell more. $u",
			"winter_Fri8": "So, @, who are you giving a gift for the Feast of the Winter Star this year? $0#$e# ...Honestly, I kind of hope it is me. $1",

			"winter_Mon10": "@, I know it's mining season for you. But... $0#$b# Be careful whenever you go to the mines, okay? It can be really dangerous down there. And I've heard that you like to say there until late in the night. $2#$e# Seb told me everything. You better take good care of yourself, young man. ^ Seb told me everything. You better take good care of yourself, young lady. $2#$b# I sound like Lewis? Well, I don't care when someone I care about gets hurt. $5", 
			
			"winter_Sun9": " It's so cold today... Hey, @. Want to unwind back at my place? $0#$b# We could read %book, Elliott's new book together, if you want. $1",

			"spouseRoom_Victor": "Hi there, honey. I picked up some books from the library. Would you like to read with me later? $1#$b# We could have some hot chocolate or tea, perhaps we could also cuddle under a warm blanket. Pure bliss, won't you say? $u#$b# I also got some books on elvish and dwarfish lore, I thought you'd find them fascinating. Not gonna lie, though... I had a little peek into those myself and almost couldn't stop reading. $1#$b# May I have a kiss for the effort? $u#$b# I love you! $4",

I enjoy taking strolls around town in the chilly weather.$1#$e#The colors of the valley seem to grow more beautiful every year. $1#$b# Hey, @, we should totally go for a stroll in the forest later.

It feels like we were getting married just yesterday. $u#$b# Oh, no need to give me anything! Really, you being with me, returning home in one piece is more than enough. Sometimes, you do give me and poor Harvey quite a scare with your ventures to the Skull Cavern. $1#$b# Unless... if you'd like to litter my face with kisses, or do a reenactment of our wedding night later tonight... I'd quite love that. $l",
